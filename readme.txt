== Description ==

Shipping module for the WP E-Commerce system that offers a matrix of weight / region combinations.

== Installation ==

*You Must* already have the following plugin installed:

1. [WP e-Commerce](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-e-commerce/)

Support for the right hooks is only available in 3.7.6 beta 3 or newer of WP E-Commerce. If you need to use this on an earlier version you'll need to apply a small change to core WP E-Commerce. The line to add is [documented here](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/198151/wp-e-commerce/trunk/wp-shopping-cart.php)

Make sure that the shipping method is selected ( Products >> Settings >> Shipping - Tick "Weight / Region Shipping" )

Configure weight rates for the regions you want to ship to.

Note: Your browser must support Javascript, and you must have it enabled to configure the shipping rates.
